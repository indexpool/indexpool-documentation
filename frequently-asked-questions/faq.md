# FAQ

### Is Picnic a liquidity pool?

No. Picnic is a secure crypto-portfolio builder and manager that helps you navigate through the DeFI farms of yield üë®üèª‚Äçüåæ, liquidity pools, lending pools or any other DeFi components.

### Is my NFT Portfolio's Wallet the same as my Metamask wallet?

No, while both can be used to store ETH (MATIC) and ERC20 tokens, your Picnic wallet enables you to batch in a single transaction the many transactions that you would need to do for the same operation in your Metamask wallet.&#x20;

For a more technical reference, your Metamask wallet is an [externally owned account](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/#types-of-account) (EOA). Your Picnic wallet is a smart contract.

### Can I sell my Portfolio NFT on OpenSea?

Yes, and in any marketplace that supports ERC721 standard. However, **note that doing this you are transferring the ownership of your portfolio to the buyer of the NFT!** This means that you will lose access to your NFT Portfolio's Wallet and the NFT buyer will have complete access to the funds in this Wallet.

### Do I receive rewards by staking in protocol X?

Yes, we support rewards for all protocols that we are integrated with. Rewards can be harvested by withdrawing the assets that generated the rewards or by editing the portfolios.

### Is there a performance fee or any other rewards for the portfolio creator?

Currently, we do not feature a performance fee nor reward the portfolio creator within the product. However, this functionality is definitely on our roadmap. In the meantime, feel free to contact us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/5AVTGwkCEs) and let us know about your ideas. We might be able to make a partnership with you before this functionality is implemented.

### How do we choose the assets available on our basket list?

We do it from our own experience from trading in DeFi. There are two components to it:&#x20;

1. We only have assets available from protocols we already integrated into our platform (quickswap, autofarm, harvest etc)&#x20;
2. From those protocols we try to include as much as possible, starting with the ones generating the highest APY at the time.
